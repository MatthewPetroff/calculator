Basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

__Memory Function Buttons:__
1. Memory Add (M+): Will add or overwrite memory with current display number.
2. Memory Clear (MC): If there is a number stored in memory, it is removed.
3. Memory Recall (MR): If a there is a number stored in memory, it is displayed on the screen.

This project taught me the importance of _designing_ the app before building it. As designs get more complex, it becomes more difficult to envision the code in your mind only. Writing pseudocode, drawing block diagrams, etc, really helps.
