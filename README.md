### Summary

Basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Memory Function Buttons:
1. Memory Add (M+): Will add or overwrite memory with current display number.
2. Memory Clear (MC): If there is a number stored in memory, it is removed.
3. Memory Recall (MR): If a there is a number stored in memory, it is displayed on the screen.

This project was project taught me the importance of _designing_ the app before building it. As designs get more complex, it becomes more difficult to envision the code in your mind only.
